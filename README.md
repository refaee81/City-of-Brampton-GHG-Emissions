City Buildings Emissions in 2018 

Energy & GHG Emissions in Brampton: An Environmental Scan
Overview: Canadian Approach 
-	Most greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be emitted by both natural processes and human activities.
-	Globally, almost 80% of GHG emissions from human sources come from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes.
-	In 2015, about 26% of Canada's total GHG emissions came from the oil and gas sector, 24% from transportation, 11% from electricity generation and 12% from buildings.
-	Canada aims to reduce its GHG emissions to 30% below its 2005 emission levels by 2030.
Some Environmental & Human health impacts 
-	Average annual temperatures are expected to increase
-	Snow, sea ice and glacier coverage will decrease
-	Future coastal-erosion rates will likely increase
-	Heat waves are likely to increase in frequency and severity
-	The increasing risk of deaths from dehydration and heat stroke
-	The risk of water-, food-, vector- and rodent-borne diseases may increase
-	Human health impacts are expected to place additional economic stress
-	Damage to infrastructure (e.g., roads and bridges) caused by extreme weather 
The Pan-Canadian Framework 
-	Price: Pricing Carbon Pollution:  According to Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission
“Carbon pricing is the most practical and cost-effective way to lower GHG emissions while encouraging low-carbon innovation.”
-	Electricity: The approach to electricity will include (1) increasing the amount of electricity generated from renewable and low-emitting sources; (2) connecting clean power with places that need it; (3) modernizing electricity systems; and (4) reducing reliance on diesel working with Indigenous Peoples and northern and remote communities.
o	E.g. On April 15, 2014, Ontario became the first jurisdiction in North America to fully eliminate coal as a source of electricity generation. This action is the single largest GHG-reduction initiative in North America, eliminating more than 30 megatonnes of annual GHG emissions.
-	Transportation: The transportation sector accounted for about 23 percent of Canada’s emissions in 2014. The approach to transportation will include (1) setting and updating vehicle emissions standards and improving the efficiency of vehicles and transportation systems; (2) expanding the number of zero-emission vehicles on Canadian roads; (3) supporting the shift from higher to lower-emitting types of transportation, including through investing in infrastructure; and (4) using cleaner fuels.
-	Industry: The approach to the industrial sector will include three main areas of action: (1) regulations to reduce methane and hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions; (2) improving industrial energy efficiency; and (3) investing in new technologies to reduce emissions. Together, these actions will help set the path for long-term clean growth and the transition to a low-carbon economy.
-	Forestry, agriculture, and waste: about 10 percent of Canada’s emissions in 2014. The approach to these sectors will include (1) enhancing carbon storage in forests and agricultural lands; (2) supporting the increased use of wood for construction; (3) generating fuel from bioenergy and bioproducts; and, (4) advancing innovation.
Federal Sustainable Development Strategy: the Strategy sets out the Government of Canada's sustainable development priorities, establishes goals and targets, and identifies actions to achieve them. The 2016-2019 Strategy - Canada's third - outlines the actions toward sustainability that the Government will take in collaboration with partners within Canada and internationally. As such, it supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its global sustainable development goals (SDGs).
Some Goals are: 
1.	Effective action on climate change: low carbon economy 
2.	Low Carbon Government
3.	Clean Growth: 
4.	Modern & resilient infrastructure 
5.	Clean Energy 
6.	Healthy Coasts, lakes, lands, water & Environment 

Ontario Approach 
O. Reg. 397/11: ENERGY CONSERVATION AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT PLANS
A required summary of the public agency’s annual energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions must include a list of the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions for the year with respect to each of the public agency’s operations.
On or before July 1, 2019 and on or before every fifth anniversary thereafter, every public agency shall publish on its website and intranet site, if it has either or both, and make available to the public in printed form at its head office all of the information that is required to be published and made available under subsection (1), the Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emission Template that is required to be submitted and published on or before July 1 of that year and the following information:
1. A description of current and proposed measures for conserving and otherwise reducing energy consumption and managing its demand for energy.
2. A revised forecast of the expected results of the current and proposed measures.
3. A report of the actual results achieved.
4. A description of any proposed changes to be made to assist the public agency in reaching any targets it has established or forecasts it has made.
 
City of Brampton: Grow Green Approach 
Brampton Grow Green is the city's first Environmental Master Plan.  It is an environmental sustainability plan that establishes strategic directions, actions and targets that will improve the environmental qualities of Brampton’s built and natural landscapes.
Grow Green Vision
Brampton is a community that will conserve, enhance and balance our natural and built environments to create a healthy, sustainable city. We will carry out our responsibilities to meet the needs of the present community without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  
Six goals represent the key outcomes the City and its partners will work to achieve: Air, Water, Land, Energy, People & Waste.
Brampton Initiatives 
The City has initiated steps to retrofit its existing corporate buildings to be more energy efficient. Initiatives include: tracking corporate energy use; auditing corporate facilities; developing facility-specific retrofit action plans; training facility operators; corporate promotion of energy efficiency standards and best practices; and monitoring outcomes.
Energy & Green House Gas (GHG)
The Region of Peel reported that the majority of its municipal energy use, including electricity and natural gas consumption, falls under two program areas: Water and wastewater treatment (representing 59% of all energy consumed, as discussed in the Water Section), and buildings and facilities (representing 40%).
Current Achievements: City of Brampton 
•	Implementation of 34 electric vehicle plug-in stations for corporate and community uses at 11 City-owned facilities
•	Development of an Energy Conservation and Demand Management Plan for City-owned facilities
•	Installation of solar power sources at Fire Station 205, Clark Transit Facility, Sandalwood Transit Facility, and Gore Meadows Recreation Centre.
Grow Green Action Plan for Energy: Complete vs. Incomplete Actions 
Complete Action: Opportunities 
-	Work with local distribution companies (Enbridge and Alectra) to develop a residential and ICI energy use database that can be used to track community energy use. 
o	A clear indication to what does the energy use database includes and how often it gets updated. Further consultations may be required. 
-	Develop a Community Energy Map
-	Explore partnership opportunities with renewable energy providers. 
-	Identify opportunities for alternative and renewable power sources at City buildings and facilities.
-	Investigate public/private partnership opportunities to integrate Feed-in Tarrif (FIT) applications onto City buildings and facilities.


Incomplete Actions: Threats
-	Work with local distribution companies (Enbridge and Alectra) to revise utility bills to illustrate usage.
-	Identify high-energy use communities and develop local action plans to reduce energy use.
-	Develop a Residential Retrofit Program to assist homeowners with energy efficiency retrofits, including Local Improvement Charges.
-	Develop a comprehensive education program about energy consumption and reduction.
-	Develop a Renewable Energy Strategy for City buildings and facilities.
-	Implement the Renewable Energy Strategy.

Thoughts & Insights: 
What are the mechanisms of research and data and how do they relate to policy and regulations in City of Brampton? 
How enhanced information accessibility could improve policy development in City of Brampton? 
How does immigration waves interrelate with the current city green grow strategy? 

Recommendations: 
-	As one of Brampton’s initiatives is to track corporate energy use within a scope of PPP’s, it is recommended to improve quality and frequency of data to be retrieved on monthly or even daily basis. This can provide better insights of the daily or monthly environmental trends or patterns, and could improve policy action and strategic planning. 
-	A transparent public manifestation of the mechanisms of research and data and how do they relate to policy and regulations in City of Brampton, in terms of: 
o	Domestic Vs. Federal Data 
o	Public Vs. Private 
o	Academic Vs. Non-Academic
-	Enhance the research activities through incentivizing the universities and research centers to have more diversified multi-source research outputs.
